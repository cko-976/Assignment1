# Overview

## Background
According to Wikipedia, the MS Estonia was a cruise ship that sank in 1994. It was one of the worst maritime disasters second only to the Titanic. In the light of this, I would like to recognize those who lost their family and friends in this tragic disaster. This work is not in any way intended to minimize the magnitude of the pain and loss.

## Goals
The goal of this work is to establish whether gender and age played a part among those who survived this disaster. It takes a deeper look at the number of men compared to women who survived. It also looks at the age of the survivors, compared to the age of the passengers.

## Data
The data for this assignment is from Kaggle Estonia Passenger List. It does not give any background information on where the data was collected. However, it does look accurate given that it has actual names of passengers and ages. In addition, this was a historial fact so the data maybe readily available. Of the 989 passengers that were aboard the ship, only 137 survived.

An inital look at the data is shown on the table below:
|Gender|Passengers|
|---|---|
|Female|486|
|Male|503|
